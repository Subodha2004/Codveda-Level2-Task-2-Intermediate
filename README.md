🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Download or clone the repository
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser
3. Start adding your tasks 🎯



 🧠 How It Works

- Tasks are stored as JavaScript objects
- Each task contains:
  - `text` – task description
  - `completed` – task status (true/false)
- Tasks are saved in `localStorage` so they remain after page refresh
